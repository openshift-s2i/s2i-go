This repository contains the source for creating a
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[source-to-image] builder image,
which be used to create reproducible Docker images from your Go project's
source code.  The resulting image can be run using https://docker.com[Docker].

For more information about using these images with OpenShift, please see
the official
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/s2i_images/php.html[OpenShift
Documentation].

[[versions]]
== Versions

Go versions currently supported are:

* Go 1.4.3
* Go 1.5.3
* Go 1.6

The following operating system base images are supported:

* CentOS 7

[[installation]]
== Installation

To build a Go builder image, execute:

-------------------------------------------------------
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-go.git
$ cd s2i-go
$ make build VERSION=1.4
-------------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can pull the CentOS image from Docker Hub via:

--------------------------------------
$ docker pull openshift/go-14-centos7
--------------------------------------

*Notice: By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action will
be performed on all the supported versions of Go.*

[[usage]]
== Usage

There are several sample Go applications included with this repository.  To
build a simple Go test application using the standalone

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ s2i build https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-go.git \
    --context-dir=1.4/test/test-app openshift/go-14-centos7 go-test-app
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The resulting image can be executed using https://docker.com[docker]:

------------------------------------------
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 go-test-app
------------------------------------------

Once the container is running, it should be accessible using:

---------------------
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080
---------------------

[[test]]
== Test

This repository also provides a test suite to check functionality of
simple Go applications built on top of the `s2i-go` image.  It can be
executed simply by running the `make test` command:

-----------------------
$ cd s2i-go
$ make test VERSION=1.4
-----------------------

*Notice: By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action will
be performed on all the supported versions of Go.*
